# TixClock
 Tix Clock using ESP8266

Version 1 of code uploaded.  Uses ESP8266, FastLED, ESP8266WebServer, WiFiManager, DNSServer, ESP8266WiFi, and Button libraries.  
ESP8266 has to use an older v2.x version of the framework due to a FastLED bug that will make the fist LED randomly turn on and off.

Will update with full instructions and link to the 3D printer files for the housing.

Changelog:

v1.0 - final release that supports daylight savings time and uses web server to store wifi credentials.
