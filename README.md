# TixClock
 Tix Clock using ESP8266

version 1.0.1 of code uploaded.  Uses ESP8266, FastLED, and Button libraries.  ESP8266 has to use an older v2.x version of the framework due to a FastLED bug that will make the fist LED randomly turn on and off.

Will update with full instructions and link to the 3D printer files for the housing.

Changelog:

v1.0 - initial release
v1.0.1 - fixed DST adjustment being one day late
